Please go through each section methodically, ensuring that you understand the criteria and can confidently attribute a score from 0 to 5 for each student's work based on their performance in the listed areas.

NB: please consider that some students may have technical issues outside of their control that impact their virtual presentations. If a student has a slow system or service outage during their presentation, they should be marked on the basis of what they were able to deliver

## Content and Organisation

This section gauges the depth of understanding and clarity of information presented about the technical project. It assesses the student's knowledge level, technical understanding, and the logical flow and structure of the presentation.

| **Score** | **Caption**     | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0         | Did not present | Student did not present.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1         | Poor            | Incoherent presentation, with no apparent structure and lacking any technical detail. Doesn't communicate a clear understanding of the requirements.                                                         |
| 2         | Fair            | Content contains some structure, but is largely disorganised with unclear transitions between topics and doesn't present the key functionality of the project.                                               |
| 3         | Adequate        | Fairly structured with an introduction, main points, and conclusion, but could be better organised. Showcases the core features of the project, but doesn't go into any technical details of implementation. |
| 4         | Good            | Mostly logical flow with an observable structure. Generally organised presentation with reasonable technical detail, perhaps including visual aids.                                                          |
| 5         | Excellent       | Polished, well-organised presentation with a clear structure and smooth transitions between topics and tools. High level of technical detail and great use of visual aids.                                   |

### Tips 
- Assess how well the student comprehends the technical project. Look for evidence of in-depth research and knowledge.
- Evaluate the clarity and coherence of the information presented. Check if complex concepts are explained clearly and concisely.
- Look for a logical progression of ideas and a well-structured sequence of topics. Assess the transitions between sections.

## Delivery and Engagement

This section focuses on the student's manner of presenting, including confidence, pace of speech, and overall demonstration of passion for the project. Also speaks to the student's ability to communicate the process and outcomes of the project.              

| **Score** | **Caption**     | **Details**                                                                                                                                           |

| 0         | Did not present | Student did not present.                                                                                                                              |
| 1         | Poor            | Very low confidence, appears unprepared/unrehearsed. Haphazard pacing, encounters major issues or navigates issues poorly.                            |
| 2         | Fair            | Fair confidence and inconsistent pacing. Shows some level of understanding with only a few stumbles, but could be better prepared.                    |
| 3         | Adequate        | Decent pacing with only one or two distractions. Reasonably confident presentation. Doesn't encounter any major issues.                               |
| 4         | Good            | Maintains a reasonable pace. Mostly confident delivery, with the ability to clearly communicate the process and outcomes of the project.              |
| 5         | Excellent       | Presents with consistent pacing and engaging tone. Appears confident and knowledgeable throughout, displays a clear level of passion for the project. |

### Tips 
- Consider if the presentation leaves a lasting impression, and inspires further interest in the topic.
- Assess the student's demonstration of enthusiasm, passion, and confidence.
- Evaluate the pace of speech (not too fast or slow) and variations in tone to maintain audience interest.
